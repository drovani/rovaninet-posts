While experimenting with ClaudeAI, I thought it would be interesting to have a conversation around how I should improve my teams in the game I have been playing. I don't remember why I started playing [Hero Wars: Alliance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexters.herowars&pcampaignid=web_share), but it is mildly entertaining and has kept my attention. There are tools that the game is missing, including assisting with creating cohesive teams with meaningful synergy. There is a lot of knowledge of the interoperability of the various heroes of the game that make the rock-paper-scissors aspect engaging.

The conversation with ClaudeAI was very informative as to how I could get meaningful information out of it. I needed to occasionally backtrack as I went down rabbit-holes that were not productive. At the end, I think I pulled together what I was looking for - a list of teams that use many of the heroes that I have already put resources into, and provide a prioritization for what attributes to improve as I continue growing.
