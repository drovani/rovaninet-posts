A friend forwarded me an article from Runner's World (written by editors at Men's Health) titled "[8 True Tests of Your Overall Fitness](http://www.runnersworld.com/workouts/8-true-tests-of-your-overall-fitness)". The article describes the test, drones on about the author's experiences, and then gives some helpful tips on how to meet the test objectives. I wanted a quick chart that I could easily reference, so I'll just post it here. The 30 pound dumbbells and 315 pound deadlift assumes 200 pound body weight.

| | STANDARD |
| STIFF ARMS PLANK | 10 seconds |
| BROAD JUMP | 7 feet |
| SQUAT, HAMMER CURL, OVERHEAD PRESS | 20 reps in 60s, 27 lb |
| FACING WALL SQUAT (2 IN) | 1 squat |
| BEEP TEST | Level 12 |
| CLAPPING PUSHUP | 10 |
| DEADLIFT | 315 lbs |
| SIT AND REACH | 17 inches |

My goal is to update these with my actual figures over the rest of the summer training season. most of the day fixing all of the question marks.
