I'm watching the Grammy's while trying to meal plan. It's terrible, because the acts go between artists that I don't care about and acts that I sort-of-kind-of want to enjoy. And then there are the performances that demand I stop what I'm doing and pay attention. These are the singers who pour their heart and soul into every word and it shows. Lady Gaga, P!nk, Bruno Mars, K$sha, Patti Lupone &ndash you can't help but be enraptured by their time on the screen. But enough about music, it's time for putting together this week's meal plan.

## What's In The Refrigerator

Last week I started planning with a "what's in the refrigerator" and I found it really helped with putting together meals. Knowing what I needed to use informed me for what I needed to cook.

- ½; bags of broccoli - good for three or four meals
- 1 bag of carrots medley - there are my new favorite way to get variety into vegetables.
- 6 bell peppers (whole)
- ¼ bell peppers (diced) - these are great for adding to salad
- Brussels sprouts - I have two bags uncut, and six meals worth chopped and in deli containers
- Salad greens - these expire quickly, so I need to used them all by Tuesday's dinner

- Tortillas
- Hamburger buns
- English muffins
- Naan

- Salmon (in the refrigerator)
- Shrimp (in the freezer)
- Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (frozen)
- Chicken thighs (frozen, 4 thighs per bag)
- Steak (frozen), probably filet mignons, individually wrapped
