Remembering what to pack, what clothes to wear, and what device accessories to bring has never been a problem for me. What inevitably causes me problems is attempting to do some work in that dreaded space of time when I am _Without Internet_. It's a terrible place to be, filled with unanswerable questions, un-updatable packages, unreviewable documentation, unwatchable shows and movies; and possibly worst of all, untouchable code repositories. Below are the list of items that I always need to remember to do the day before any planned travel - be it by car or by airplane - because time without internet access doesn't have to be wasted time browsing a magazine or reading a book or practicing Italian on Duolingo.

## Laptop Updates

1. Open _Visual Studio Code_ and ensure everything is up-to-date
  1. Check for _VS Code_ updates
  1. Sync local repository with ```origin```
  1. Update the Linux subsystem, update all gems, and verify that _Jekyll_ will serve this blog
    1. ```sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get autoremove -y```
    1. ```sudo gem update```
    1. ```bundle exec jekyll serve```
1. Verify that _Visual Studio_ is up-to-date, including all extensions
  1. Sync local repository with ```origin```
1. Download some shows and a movie to _Netflix_
1. Download some playlists to _Spotify_
1. Reboot a couple of times, just to make sure everything is still working
