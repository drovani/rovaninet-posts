This is an experimental recipe. I tried it once, and then it clearly needed some tweaking. I've made the changes in the recipe below, and if it needs more adjustments after the second time through, I'll come back and update this post.

## Ingredients Needed

### French fries

- Russet potatoes
- 3 lb. lard

### Hamburgers

- 1 lb. ground beef (85% lean)
- Â¼ cup minced onions
- 2 tbsp. BBQ sauce
- 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp. soy sauce
- 1 tbsp. Dijon mustard

### Cooking Steps

**An hour before serving**

1. Fill large pot with water and 2 tbsp. salt, starting heating
1. Peel and slice potatoes (using [Potato French Fry Cutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VU2HR6/), largest size fries)
1. Once water is boiling, put first batch of fries into the water
1. Cook for 4-5 minutes - long enough to be soft, but not too long that they break when you hold them
1. Set cooked fries on a cookie sheet with paper towels
1. Let water return to a rolling boil, and repeat until all fries are cooked
1. Thoroughly mix all hamburgers ingredients (knead by hand)
1. Divide meat into 2 oz. portions
1. Form portions into very thin patties

**30 minutes before serving**

1. Place large in large pot (can be the one previously used for boiling)
1. Turn heat on high, and bring to 380&deg;F ([OXO Good Grips Glass Fry Thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L9X2RZS/))

**10 minutes before serving**

1. Heat cast iron skillet on high
1. Place two or three patties on skillet at a time
1. Heat for 1-2 minutes (they cook quickly), then flip for 1-2 more minutes
1. Remove from skillet and place on warming plate or serve
