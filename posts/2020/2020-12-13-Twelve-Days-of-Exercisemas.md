Unless otherwise noted, each workout is done once-per-hour for twelve hours in a day. For me, I'll be doing this from 7am to 7pm. Much like the song, each exercise is performed on all subsequent days, too.

On the twelfth day of Christmas, the exercises that I'll do:

- 12 back lunges (each leg)
- 11 mountain climbers (each leg)
- 10 hip bridges
- 90 second planks
- 8 tricep bench dips
- 7 side lunges (each side)
- 6 situps
- 5 mile run (once per day)
- 4 front lunges (each leg)
- 3 pushups
- 2 squats
- 1 Burpee
