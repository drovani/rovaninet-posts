2016 was a busy year - in total, I ran eight races. While four of them were all in one weekend for [Disney's Dopey Challenge](/posts/2016/disney-s-dopey-challenge/), it was still a lot of early mornings for me. For 2017, I am going to scale things back a bit - which really just means removing the one racing weekend.

## F3 Half Marathon

My favorite half marathon in Chicago is the [F^3 Lake Half Marathon](http://www.f3running.com/). My current personal record for a half marathon is 1:36:44, coming from last year's race. I enjoy the race because it is small enough that I feel competative, but it is large enough that the course does not feel empty. My first goal is to clear 1:35:00, with a rocket goal of finishing under 1:30:00 (6:51/mile). Ninty minutes to run 31.1 miles. Just thinking about it makes me think I might be approaching an acceptable pace to be called fast. This race is heavily weather dependent; if winds are calm and the course is dry, then I expect good things.

## Kalamazoo Marathon

I have been doing a different spring marathon each year for the past two years - [Wisconsin](/posts/2015/3-56-58-2015-wisconsin-marathon/) and [New Jersey](https://results.chronotrack.com/event/results/event/event-13270?entryID=16657247). In the spirit of trying something new, I'll be heading to Michigan for this year's spring marathon, running the [Kalamazoo Marathon at the Borgess Run](https://thekalamazoomarathon.com/). My goal is to finish under 3:15:00 (7:26/mile); which, conveniently, is also the fastest pace group that the race offers. My goal is to hold tight with them for as long as I can. If I am feeling really good after 18 miles, then I might try to go ahead of them. Otherwise, I will be thoroughly thrilled with crossing with the group. As with all of my races, the minimum goal for me is to beat my PR of 3:21:43.

## Some Unnamed 5k

For the past four years, I have run the [Burgers & Beer 5k](http://www.universalsole.com/burgers--beer-5k.html). I am undecided if I want to run that race again, or find some other 5k. Last year, I was doing a #Whole30, so I couldn't eat the burger or the beer. It lost a lot of the luster. I would be willing to do it again, if I knew that I would not be on a restricted diet on race day. Otherwise, I will run one of the many other 5k races the city has during the summer. My options are not slim. My goal would be to beat my PR - 19:21 (6:13/mile).

## Chicago Marathon 2017

This will be my fifth Chicago Marathon in a row, and if all goes well, will be the race that I finally qualify for the Boston Marathon - thus running that race in April 2019. Since I would be 37 on race day, my qualifying standard is 3:10:00; but with the way they do actual selection, I am aiming for 3:05:00 (7:03/mile). Five full minutes under the standard should be plenty to clear selection cutoffs.
