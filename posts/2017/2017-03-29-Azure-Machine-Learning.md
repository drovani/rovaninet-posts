These are some notes that I typed up during an Azure Machine Learning - Data Camp that I attended at the Microsoft learning center in the Aon building. It was entertaining, informative, and all around a great session; unfortunately, it was entirely useless for my job, since this really has nothing to do with the work that I perform. On the plus side - I was able to recommend to my co-workers on the Analytics team that _they_ should attend it.

- Data science is about using _data_ to _make decisions_ that _drive actions_, involving Data Selection, Preprocessing, Transformation, Data Mining, Delivering value from data (interpretation and evaluation).
- Challenges have been extremely complex overhead, expensive startup, and steep learning curves. The goal of Azure Machine Learning Services is to provide a simpler and scalable method.
- Machine Learning is using _known data_ to develop a _model_ to _predict unknown data_.
  - **Known Data**: Big enough archive, previous observations, past data
  - **Model**: Known data + algorithms (ML algorithms)
  - **Unknown Data**: Missing, unseen, not existing, future data
- Microsoft's usage of ML: 1997 Hotmail spam filters, 2008 Bing maps routing, 2009 Bing search, 2010 Kinect
- Azure Machine Learning's goal - Make machine learning accessible to every enterprise, data scientist, developer, information worker, consumer, and device anywhere in the world.

- Expect that 75% of the time will be building the model and testing validity of predictions.
- Cycle of Steps to building a machine learning solution
  - Frame the problem
  - Get and Prepare Data
  - Develop the Model
    - Analysis / Metric Definition
    - Feature Engineering
    - Model Training
    - Parameter Tuning
    - Evaluation
  - Deploy Model
  - Evaluate / Track Performance


- ML Algorithm defines how your _model_ will react
  - Written in R or Python


- Classification: answer yes/no
- Regression: predict a numeric value
- Anomaly Detection: value outside of bounds
- Clustering: unsupervised learning, group like data
