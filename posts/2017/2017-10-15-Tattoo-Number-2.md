It's been far too long since my second child was born, but we finally booked the tattoo appointment. As I did with my first, I got a tattoo with the latitude, longitude, date, and time of his birth. Finding the right font is hard - I wanted something that doesn't completely contrast with the existing tattoo, but was still distinct. Eventually, this is what I ended up putting together.

<div class="overflow-x-scroll whitespace-nowrap">
<span style="font-family: 'Vollkorn', serif; font-size: 2.7rem;">41&deg;56&#39;11&quot;<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">N</span> 87&deg;39&#39;03&quot;<span  style="font-size: 1.25em;">W</span>&nbsp;2017-05-29<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">T</span>20:10</span>
</div>
