There's something uniquely challenging about trying to enjoy family time while an invisible clock counts down in your mind. Three months. That's what I have to find my next role before financial pressure becomes a real problem. Yet here I am, watching my kids splash in the pool waters of Sarasota, trying to be fully present while my mind occasionally drifts to unanswered emails and networking connections I should be nurturing.

## The Unexpected Career Shift

A few weeks ago, I was leading a technology team. Today, I'm part of the growing club of tech leaders navigating the aftermath of management restructuring. The transition from "David, Chief Technology Officer" to just "David, job seeker" happened faster than I could process. One minute I was planning our Q2 roadmap; the next, I was updating my LinkedIn profile and reaching out to contacts I haven't spoken with in years.

When my family's spring break vacation plans came up – our long-awaited drive from Chicago to Florida – I briefly considered canceling. "How can I justify a week away when finding a new executive position should be my full-time job?" The thought kept me up at night. But my wife reminded me that our children had been looking forward to this trip for months, and perhaps the mental reset would ultimately serve my job search better than another week of refreshing job boards.

## The Two-Day Drive: Sanity While Not Being Able To Do Anything

As [VeryWellMind](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-compartmentalize-to-reduce-stress-7373131) explains, compartmentalizing helps you "divide your thoughts, emotions, or experiences into distinct mental 'compartments' to manage them more efficiently," which enables you to concentrate on one aspect of your life at a time. This is a skill that I have had for as long as I can remember - one that has been instrumental in getting me through the most stressful parts of my life. This is also how I have been approaching the current situation.

The long drive to Florida became an unexpected sanctuary. While the kids were absorbed in movies, reading, or napping in the backseat, my wife and I had hours of uninterrupted conversation—something that's become increasingly rare at home. We talked about her work challenges, the office politics she's navigating, and colleagues who both inspire and frustrate her. These conversations felt almost therapeutic—completely disconnected from my job search but deeply connecting us as partners facing life's challenges together.

The beauty of these extended car conversations is their meandering nature. We'd start discussing her upcoming presentation, drift into memories of past vacations, and share our hopes for the kids' summer activities. The enforced stillness of the car created space for the kind of rambling, honest dialogue that busy schedules at home often prevent.


## Setting Expectations with Yourself and Your Partner

Once we arrived in Sarasota for our five-day stay, I knew I needed a more sustainable approach. The breakthrough came when I stopped thinking in binary terms – that I was either "on vacation" or "job hunting" – and instead acknowledged that this period required a thoughtful hybrid approach.

What's been particularly challenging is communication with my wife, despite this normally being a strength for us. We're both stressed about money and the job search, and despite our best efforts, the kids have picked up on the tension. [HeadsUpGuys](https://headsupguys.org/reducing-family-stress-better-communication/) offers a helpful reminder about family communication during stressful times: give your partner "the space to talk without interrupting to offer your opinion or advice" and ask questions like "What can I do to help you feel less stressed?" rather than immediately jumping to solutions.

Here's what's working for me:

1. **The sunrise routine**: I wake up at my normal time, which is about an hour before everyone else, to review job listings, send follow-up emails, and plan networking outreach. Something about tapping away at the keyboard before anyone else is stirring has felt less intrusive than stealing time throughout the day.

2. **Setting realistic microtasks**: Instead of vague pressure to "job search," I set one specific, achievable task each day. Yesterday it was updating one section of my resume; today it's finalize and publishing this post, tomorrow it's sending three targeted connection requests. The [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/conquer-job-search-anxiety) platform suggests this approach can help reduce job search anxiety by making the process more manageable.

3. **Permission to disconnect**: Once my daily microtask is complete, I give myself permission to fully disconnect. The phone goes into "vacation mode" – notifications off, job search apps in a folder I won't see. Career experts at [Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-compartmentalize-work-and-life-stress-during/348428) recommend this approach, noting that "after completing an assignment, make the conscious decision to move forward. It's time to focus on yourself".

4. **Physical movement as mental release**: I've been surprisingly disciplined about swimming laps every other morning and taking long walks around the campground daily. What started as a way to maintain my marathon training schedule has become crucial mental hygiene. The rhythmic nature of swimming especially provides a meditative space where job search anxieties can't penetrate. Research consistently shows that physical activity reduces stress hormones while increasing endorphins—exactly what a job-searching executive on vacation needs.

## The Relief of Lowered Expectations

Perhaps the most important shift has been lowering my expectations about what's possible during this time. The reality is that hiring processes often slow down during popular vacation weeks. Many decision-makers are themselves out of office.

I've found unexpected relief in accepting that a perfectly orchestrated job search isn't realistic right now. This doesn't mean giving up – it means acknowledging the season I'm in and adjusting accordingly.

The mental burden lightens considerably when I remind myself: "My primary job this week is being present with my family. My secondary job is keeping basic momentum in my search." Executive career coach [Kirby Partners](https://www.kirbypartners.com/executive-job-search-strategies/) emphasizes the importance of this kind of self-care, noting that staying organized and maintaining motivation are critical parts of managing the job search process.

## The Drive Home: Planning the Push

As we prepare for our return journey, I'm mentally preparing for the shift back to more intensive job searching. Rather than dreading this transition, I've found myself looking forward to applying renewed energy to the process.

I'm using some of our driving time to outline my strategy for the coming weeks – companies to prioritize, connections to nurture, and specific roles to pursue. The mental space this vacation has provided, despite my initial resistance, has clarified my professional priorities in ways that endless hours scrolling job boards never could.

Moneesh Arora had a good [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-10-job-search-strategies-tips-executives-overview-moneesh-arora) post from a few years ago, recommending this kind of strategic planning, suggesting that executives should "treat job search and networking like a 'real' job" with clear plans, accountability and metrics.

## For Fellow Tech Leaders Between Roles

If you find yourself in similar circumstances – trying to balance family commitments with the urgency of a job search – here's what I'm learning:

- The pressure we put on ourselves is often disproportionate to what's actually required to maintain momentum
- Short, focused sessions can be more productive than constant, distracted availability
- Being fully present with family actually creates mental space that benefits your professional clarity
- Time away doesn't equal falling behind; sometimes it means getting ahead in less tangible ways

[HelpGuide.org](https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/stress/job-loss-and-unemployment-stress) reinforces this approach, noting that "social contact is nature's antidote to stress" and that taking time for family can actually help you handle the stress of unemployment better.

The financial pressure of my situation hasn't changed. I still need to secure a new technology leadership role within the next three months. But my approach to this challenge has evolved. I'm discovering that balance isn't about perfect equilibrium – it's about intentional choices in imperfect circumstances.

As I watch my children build what might be their last sandcastle of this trip, I realize that someday, they won't remember whether I found a new position in six weeks or eight. But they will remember whether I was truly with them during these rare days together.

And somehow, that perspective makes the weight of my job search feel a little lighter as we prepare for the long drive back to Chicago.
