# Sandbox Side Projects

Some of the side projects that I have started as a way to experiment with new (to me) frameworks, languages, and other tech.

## [Media Consumption](/media-consumption)

In order to keep track of what shows I'm watching, on what networks, and when they are coming back for the next season - who can even remember all of this?!

So I made a service to let me track what I want and I'm working to make it self-sufficient.

For a hot minute, I was really into the [Mercenaries](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/mercenaries) mode of [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us). I was frustrated with the game's inability to peak at the different levels of skills and items, and I wanted the ability to track what was in my collection from outside of the game. At the time, I was first learning how to create Vue 3 projects using the Composition API, Tailwind CSS, and FontAwesome. I also included experiments with [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) data store and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.

I fell off from playing the game in early 2022 and my interest in the project faded with it.
