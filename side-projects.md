# Sandbox Side Projects

Some of the side projects that I have started as a way to experiment with new (to me) frameworks, languages, and other tech.

## [Hero Wars: Alliance Helper](https://herowars.rovani.net)

Since the [acquisition by Shopify of the Remix project](https://shopify.engineering/remix-joins-shopify), I wanted to really dive into the framework as a way to learn React and be better informed on how it could be used within a Shopify storefront. As I was pondering what the project should be based around, I picked up the mobile game [Hero Wars: Alliance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/Hero_Wars_Alliance?id=com.nexters.herowars) to idly pass time. There were many data-based questions I had (how much of resource A do I need to be stockpiling? what's my win/loss ratio against various opponents and teams? what missions should I focus on raiding for maximizing resources?), so I thought I'd build a tool to help compile the information and provide me with insights.

It's still a work in progress (as of December 2024). The lessons I have learned about React, Remix ([now React Router v7](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7)), Tailwind, and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components has been very informative and exciting to tinker with.

## [Media Consumption](/media-consumption)

In order to keep track of what shows I'm watching, on what networks, and when they are coming back for the next season - who can even remember all of this?!

So I made a service to let me track what I want and I'm working to make it self-sufficient.

## [HS Mercs Helper](https://hsmercs.rovani.net)

For a hot minute, I was really into the [Mercenaries](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/mercenaries) mode of [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us). I was frustrated with the game's inability to peak at the different levels of skills and items, and I wanted the ability to track what was in my collection from outside of the game. At the time, I was first learning how to create Vue 3 projects using the Composition API, Tailwind CSS, and FontAwesome. I also included experiments with [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) data store and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.

I fell off from playing the game in early 2022 and my interest in the project faded with it.
