excerpt: Welcome to the Next.js interation of the Rovani.net website.

I have left the Vue world and embarked on new adventure in learning how to work with React. My first project was to rebuild this website using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), keeping [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), and [Netlify](https://rovaninet)[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b2009454-0f58-40af-b988-f83660d44634/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rovaninet-nextjs/deploys). Recognizing that I will probably be continuing to rebuild the front-end, I decided to split out the blog posts into their [own repo](https://github.com/drovani/rovaninet-posts) and use `git submodule` to pull the files into this project. I'm particularly excited about this feature.

There are a couple of [side projects](/side-projects) that I have in mind to add some experience with React.

Welcome to the new codebase for [Rovani's Sandbox](https://rovani.net).
