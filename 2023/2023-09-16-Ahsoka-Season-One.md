title: "Ahsoka: Season One"
series: Star Wars Commentary
excerpt: "_Ahsoka_, the latest show about Jedi on _Disney+_, continues the tradition of template storytelling, lots of Easter eggs (even blatently thrown at the unknowing as if to taunt them for not knowing), and solidat action sequences. There are spoilers, but I don't care; this is best understood if you have already watched the season."

I am going into this series with nearly no knowledge of the _Ahsoka Tano_ character, nor any other _Star Wars_ lore outside of the movies and a few live-action shows.

> The first in a series of posts on ['My Thoughts on _Ahsoka_'](/series/star-wars-commentary) and other _Star Wars_ series. A new thread after each season!

## Part One: Master and Apprentice

- "I'm calling their bluff." I like this captain! "Signal them to come aboard." You fool - I hate you.
- I'm getting strong Jonathan Frakes fibes from Baylan.
- I appreciate that very early in the show, we learn exactly how to pronounce "Ahsoka".
- Requisite epic green-screen special effects set with the cloaked protagonist seeking out something underground.
- This puzzle is straight out of a video game - turning pedastels, glowing success indicators, revealing the treasure, an ambush after retrieval.
- Queue the "this is a badass protagonist, watch!"
- Why would the self-destruct take so long and why couldn't the robots give chase while the explosives charge?
- A little bit of exposition and then a new waypoint on the quest hub.
- It's almost like I'm supposed to know that's a Mandalorian helmet? Or maybe a helmet that the idiots like me think is Mandalorian but true fans know what it really is?
- Why would a member of the Sith have a braided strand of hair? It serves no practical purpose; she gains no tactical advantage having it; idleness or affection would cause its creation. It's an unnecessary and distracting character flourish. I hope there is some backstory about that braid in a future episode.
- Are you surprised that the (ex-?)apprentice who doesn't listen to authority absconded off with the map she was told to keep in the ship? Shocking turn of events.
- Oh snap! Anakin!!!
