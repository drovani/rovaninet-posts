I started this post with an idea.  I got as far as the title, then somewhere between that text box and the text area below it, I completely lost what I was going to write.  I just stared at my fingers sitting diligently on the keyboard, waiting for me to give them commands.

These thoughts are mine, but what about when I cannot summon the thoughts.  I thought I had several easy-to-hammer-out blog posts ready to go.  I thought I would at least last for a few days before I completely blocked myself from being able to type.  Apparently, twenty-four hours is enough.

Today is supposed to be a [Meats](http://marketing.linkedin.com/blog/the-blogging-food-groups-a-well-balanced-diet-of-content-infographic/) day for writing.  I am not entirely sure what that is supposed to mean, but I think I have plenty of ideas for what to put together.  So today's meat post is going to be about what future meat posts I am going to write.  These include:

- Cross posts with my Laivani project, wherein I learn about donor management systems and modern WISC coding patterns as I go along.
- A more comprehensive documentation of Knockout's utility functions.
- Other posts about important things.

This experiment is going to be a disaster; I can tell already.
