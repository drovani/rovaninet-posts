After a lot of frustration, digging through docs and issues, hitting dead ends, panicing over DNS configuration, and finally rejoicing in getting it working - this site is now hosted with [Netlify](https://rovaninet-gridsome.netlify.app)[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/aad9cac8-4737-4708-a70f-104749fcd8d7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rovaninet-gridsome/deploys). I have rebuilt it using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) (code repo is still in [GitHub](https://github.com/drovani/rovaninet-gridsome)). This originally started as a project to build a [Hearthstone Mercenaries Helper](/mercenaries-helper) app, but quickly morphed into "I think I'll just rebuild the whole site". I hope to soon create a "making of" series of posts and then create a started template. I have a few websites that I think would benefit from switching to this stack, so repeatability of the process will benefit me greatly.

Until then, welcome to the new home of [Rovani dot net](https://rovani.net).
