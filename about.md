# David Rovani, Résumé

## Passions and Motivators

With a passion for innovation, team leadership, strategic planning, and mentorship, I have created a career that centers around communication, continuous learning, and organizational influence. I focus on improvements to the people, processes, and technology that deliver ever increasing value to businesses and customers.

I enjoy pushing the boundaries of technology and finding new ways to solve problems or improve existing processes. I have a deep love for technology and a desire to stay current with the latest trends and developments, balancing between providing high-level direction to team members and diving into the technical details of projects.

I am motivated by complex problem-solving, thriving on tackling challenging technical issues and finding creative solutions. It is particularly satisfying when it leads to improvements in the company's products or services, be they internal tools or externally facing projects.

Where I get most pride from is in team leadership. Building high-performing teams, mentoring and developing talent, creating a positive work environment, fostering effective communication, setting clear expectations, and empowering decision-making... these are all some of the most rewarding moments in my career and what I strive to inspire in others every day.

### Director of Information Services at _IFCJ_

November 2012 to October 2019

:::aside{.lead}
The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ) is a global non-profit with offices in Chicago, Toronto, Brazil, South Korea, and Jerusalem providing humanitarian work in the eastern Mediterranean and former Soviet Union regions of the world. With annual revenue of $120m, IFCJ exists in an operational space with needs that reach into enterprise-level solutions, but within a budget designed to maximize stewardship of donors' contributions.
:::

My time at The Fellowship was highlighted by moments of teaching and mentoring my team; growing and adapting the Information Services department to meet the ever changing needs of the company; and the ongoing work of maintaining and enhancing the custom built donor management system (KesherNet).

Overseeing a team of 3 application developers, 2 database administrators, and a data hygienist, my role was both manager/mentor for the team and the senior technical resource. The department was responsible for ensuring that the organization has timely access to accurate data that is securely stored yet easily accessible. Information was retrieved from dozens of vendors through file imports, API calls, webhooks, and manual keying. The data was accessed by internal users through KesherNet, through custom reports, and shared with vendors through file exports.

KesherNet is a web application written in C# on the ASP.NET and EF frameworks connecting to Microsoft SQL Server databases. It includes modules that handle payment processing (CC, ACH, and PayPal), fully templated receipt printing, weekly/monthly/quarterly (and other odd cadence) scheduled gifts, highly adaptable list segmentations, and many other custom tools that support business processes. I was the lead developer on the initial project to build the application, replacing a vendor’s legacy system that had reached its end-of-life. I continued to be the architect and lead developer while teaching and directing junior staff to take on more responsibilities as they learn and grow.

Several later projects used an assortment of technologies and platforms, including Azure Functions, CosmosDb, App Services, and API Management to build a donation API for the publicly facing website; implemented code review and check-in policies and governance; and began creating the architecture of a fully cloud-native, open-source donor management solution to replace the current system.

Initial position at IFCJ was as a Senior .NET Developer, then after a year was promoted to .NET Developer Team Lead. Two years later, promoted to Manager of Application Development. Received promotion to Director of Information Services in November 2017.
