I am working on migrating my blog from the old hosted Wordpress site that I was using to be hosted by GitHub pages, powered by Jekyll.

Why, you might ask. Because I can.

Also, because I want to use my domain to host this, and I _think_ that I can do that with Google Domains and this site. We'll see how that works out.

## Progress

- 2016-08-11: I migrated from the beginning through 02 April 2014. It's a good start, I think.
- 2016-08-12: I've migrated through 23 Jan 2015. Slowly but surely!
- 2016-08-17: Since I had to fix the encoding on all of the markdown files, I spent most of the day fixing all of the question marks.
- 2016-08-24: I migrated everything from the Wordpress blog, and some of the more important posts from Exactly One Hobby.
